      <h1>HELP!!!! MY CODE HAS AN ERROR IN IT! MY HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT IS DUE IN AN HOUR! I NEED HELP!!!</h1>
      <p>
        Does this sound familiar? Maybe you were the one panicking. Maybe you were the one reading this
        sentence and thinking "why'd you wait until the last minute to do your homework?"
      </p>
      <p>
        What <b><i>I</i></b> think when I see this is "what <i>is</i> the error?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I often answer programming questions that I come across in online forums or discord servers.
        It's also often painfully clear when someone doesn't take the time to describe the problem
        they actually have. When you say "error", what exactly do you mean? I often use the saying
        <blockquote>
          There are a million ways something can "not work". Every single one of those is a different
          problem with a different solution. I can't possibly know what's wrong without you describing
          what the problem actually is.
        </blockquote>
        To show you what I mean, let me emulate what a help request I'm trying to discourage might look
        like:
        <blockquote>
          My player isn't moving right or down. When I press down, it goes up. When it gets to the edge
          of the screen, it doesn't move past it. When I move, the old one still shows up. Help me!
          I don't know what I'm doing and ChatGPT said that I need to fill the screen, but when I do that
          I don't see anything anymore. Help me!
        </blockquote>
